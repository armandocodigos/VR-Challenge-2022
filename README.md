# VR-Challenge-2022

https://www.research.colostate.edu/virtualreality/vr-challenge/

The challenge offers a unique opportunity for students to build interdisciplinary teams and solve faculty-provided challenges through VR technology.

The event’s goal is to provide experience in virtual and augmented reality and help students reach their professional goals. In addition to cash prizes, winning teams also have the chance to continue their work with the faculty who posed the original problem their projects aim to solve. 

Students studying graphic arts, psychology, computer science or engineering will particularly enjoy this year’s challenge, which is open to undergraduates, graduate students and postdocs. However, there are no limitations on who can participate, and foundational resources will be provided to all participants.
